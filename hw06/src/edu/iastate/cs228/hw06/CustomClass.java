 * 
 * NOTE: 
 * 0. Put your Firstname and Lastname after above author tag.
 * 			Make sure that in both cases the first letter is uppercase
 *    and all others are lowercase.
 * 1. You are allowed to create and use your own private helper methods. 
 * 2. No additional data fields can be introduced.
 * 3. No custom classes of your own can be introduced or used.
 * 4. Import statements are not allowed.
 * 5. Fully qualified class names usage is not allowed.
 *    (Except for the methods that are provided already for you, which
 *    do not need to be implemented as part of this HW, i.e. needs to be
 *    used as it is.)
 * 6. You are allowed to reuse any part of the source codes of provided
 *    or shown under lecture notes.
 *    
 * All above 0 - 6 apply also to AList, LList, and LListWithTail.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 *    All methods in this class need to be overridden in all of AList, 
 *    LList, and LListWithTail classes as per contract. You are allowed 
 *    to reuse already implemented methods in there while implementing
 *    these.
 * 
 * HINT:
 *    You are allowed to provide an implementation, i.e., body, of these
 *    methods here. In that case remove the abstract keyword. Otherwise,
 *    if you are providing implementation in specific classes then you 
 *    need to add @author tag in those classes with your name, and keep
 *    the abstract keyword in the signature of the methods below. In the
 *    former case, i.e., when you remove the abstract keywords here and
 *    provide the implementations here, no need to provided @author tag
 *    in classes AList, LList, and LListWithTail.
